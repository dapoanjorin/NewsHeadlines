# NewsHeadlines

This is an Android app that displays the latest news headline fetched from a server API [News API](https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us).
The app uses a single activity to display the headlines and provides offline accessibility.

## :scroll: Architecture Overview 
The app uses the MVVM Clean architecture approach which assumes separation of concerns with UI(Activity, Fragment, View), Presentation(ViewModel), Domain(Entities, Models) and Data(Repository) layers.
